# Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS) 

A six session course that explores ways in which computational methods can advance the applications of policy and strategy research. 

The course focuses on the potential of video games – and intelligent agents programmed in Python to play these games – to study strategic behaviour in complex, simulated environments.

CAPS aims to introduce policy students to the technical and conceptual aspects of modern AI through learning hands-on how to build game-playing agents for StarCraft II. 

### Updates
**December 2018.** The first iteration of CAPS was completed.

Thank you to all the students who participated and helped create a great environment for learning about computation, policy and strategy. Video recordings of the six sessions are forthcoming.
We are currently expanding CAPS into a more dedicated learning environment and will start the next iteration in late March 2019. Stay tuned for updates!

**January 2019.** DeepMind releases [AlphaStar](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/), solving the full game of StarCraft II.

When we started CAPS in October 2018, this achievement seemed at least some years away. Fascinating to see the fast pace of AI research. Note, that the slides found in the course materials here are pre-Alpha Star. 

**May 2019.** The second iteration of CAPS was completed.

We have expanded CAPS, turning our workshop into an official professional developement course at Johns Hopkins. You can find the new home of CAPS on GitHub [here](https://github.com/capsseminar).

### :computer: Install Guidelines

#### python-sc2
* Open your command line (if you do not know where the command line is on your system, search "cmd" in Windows explorer or "terminal" in Apple spotlight search). In your command line, type ```pip install sc2```. This will install python-sc2. To check whether you have installed python-sc2, open Python and type ```import sc2```. If you don't get an error at this stage, you're good. 

#### Download StarCraft II
* Download StarCraft II from the [official Battlenet website](https://us.battle.net/account/download/). StarCraft II is free to play but requies you to set up an account at Battlenet
* Install StarCraft into your ```C``` drive. 
* You can also install StarCraft into a different drive. However, you will then need to update this location in the ```paths.py``` file of the ```SC2``` (python-sc2) folder. This folder is located in Python's ```site-packages``` folder. You can find ```site-packages``` through your command line. Type ```python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())```. This will show you where on your computer ```site-packages``` is located.  In the ```SC2``` folder open ```paths.py``` and under ```BASEDIR = {``` replace the default location of StarCraft with your chosen location for your respective operating system (Darwin for Apple). 

#### Download StarCraft Maps
* Download the maps from [Blizzard's GitHub](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs). Any season is fine
* Extract the map files into the "Maps" folder in your "StarCraft" folder. If you don't have a "Maps" folder, create it first 
* When you extract the files, you will be asked for a password. The password is 'iagreetotheeula'

### :coffee: Project Samples

* [Balancing Depth vs. Breadth Search Behavior in Explainable AI](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/CAPS/Project%20Samples/CAPS_Project_Sample_Short_Report.pdf) This is an example of a **short report** project on information constraints for explainable AI in battlefield environments. No code, just analysis supported by basic references to search algortihms. Draws on research on autonomous weapons systems and StarCraft gameplay. 
* More to come
